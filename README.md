# ðŸ“Š Netflix Movie Data Analysis

This project analyzes Netflix movie data to examine trends in movie durations over the years. Using a dataset from an Excel file (`netflix_data.xlsx`), the analysis generates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between release year and movie duration.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Reads movie data from `netflix_data.xlsx`
- Cleans and processes the dataset
- Generates a scatter plot to investigate how movie durations have changed over time

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- The scatter plot helps identify trends in movie durations across different release years.
- It provides insights into whether movies have become shorter or longer over time.
